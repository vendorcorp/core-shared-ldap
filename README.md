# The Fine Print

At the time of writing I work for Sonatype, and it is worth nothing that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** bu Sonatype - it is purely a contribution to the open source community (read: you!).

Remember:
- Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
- Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to cheque support in regard to this project
- DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in
